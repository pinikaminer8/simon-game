# Color Pattern Game

Welcome to the Color Pattern Game! This is a simple JavaScript-based game where you can test your memory by repeating color patterns.
I did this project as part of The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp by Dr. Angela Yu

## How to Play

1. Press any key to start the game.
2. A sequence of colors will appear and play a sound.
3. Your task is to click the buttons in the same order as the sequence.
4. If you complete a level, the game will progress to the next level with an additional color in the pattern.
5. If you make a mistake, you'll hear a "wrong" sound, and the game will end. You can restart by pressing any key again.

Have fun and test your memory and reflexes!
